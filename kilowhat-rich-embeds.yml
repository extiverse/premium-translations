                This feature retrieves and displays additional information on external images inserted in posts with bbcode or markdown.
                At this time it re-uses the same blacklist/whitelist and permissions as rich links.
                These images are not proxied through the OpenGraph image proxy.
                You must clear the Flarum cache after changing this setting.
