    reminderBod: This is a friendly reminder that Two-factor authentication has been enabled on your account. This means that when logging in, you will need to enter a code generated by your TOTP app, Authy, or via a text message on your phone in addition to entering your usual username and password. Remember to keep your recovery codes in a safe place. You will need one of them to log into your account should you lose access to your mobile device.
